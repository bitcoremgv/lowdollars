the checking package
to
the db package







the db package is


the ledgers used for the dbs and dbs datas formated for dbs

id ledger
 for checkers to that is the meters
 and checkers datas schemes

wallet ledger
 for wallets   cryptos used low dollars crypted

rewards ask ledger
to have the mean ask of checkers
low dollars

datas ledger
 to have all currenc  datas for a rwards ask and to assess it
 all courrency datas

constancy ledger
  unconstancy should be assessed and this is the issues to be assessed
  all issues that are unconstant or unconsistant or pertinent
    constancy ledgering sends a constancy ask for checkers to check the constancy issue and they can check the ledgers as it check this
	constancy check can be send for no issues or for issues


checkers ledger
 to check checkers
 their ledgers checking   their send back   their constancy ask

cryptos ledger
 the cryptos used and their

the checking package

is the tasks for the dbs

for checkers to be
 checking db ledgers
 sending back
 asking rewards
 asking constancy










the send send back packages

is the thing that are used for sending asks
rewards asks
constancy asks
reebncryption aks for wallets
the wallets and the checkers are using it

and sending back
 for decryption asks
 for the decrypted
 for constancy asks










wallets packages
 is the wallets needs and wallets
 it is used to have a wallet or to agree for wallet to be used
 no dbs for wallets











the checkers package
are the
 checking package
 db package
 send send back package










as checkers
 they have the package and their   that is used for the send send back package
 they use it

as a wallet
 use a wallet


the dbs are odbms









the wallets are reencrypters
crypt a elements
send crypted and cryptos used

to use it
send decryption ask

ledger reencryption and cryptos used









to address issues

addressing issues
unconstancy for a ledger or a ledger sent back
assessing issue
for
regularity
gravity
procedures
tasks
ledgers
dbs
packages
checking ledger constancy

addressing it as sporadic or recurrent

for using version it should have the idea of packaging dbs used dependence innovation
reconstancing the ledgers or versions
should use the concepts of the    there is to have the things there is innovation forking a version or redoing it

a unconsitancy for a ledger sends a constancy check to checkers















asking for rewards

to ask for rewards
the checker send to the rewards ask ledger
the ledger allow a mean rewards and limit excess
the mean rewards ask is sent to the rewards ledger
checkers are checking to the mean rewards
as checking or checkers needs   the ask for rewards can be sent for no excesses
a recurence minimum can

the askers might need to be using the     to have a proper ask
and to    be using it
and they use the datas ledger
it is the ledger for the expertise they need


the ask for rwards is used to limit excesses and
not to loose the awarded rewards
and having rewards awarding
and to have competition


to maximize or minimize the rewards is to maximize or minimize
the
    checking
the inflation
the popularity
   
checking is rewarded to the mean ask of rewards


inflation is the cost of transaction

maximizing the rewards maximize checking and inflation
loosing awarded rewards for inflation

minimizing the rewards minimize checking and inflation
not loosing awarded rewards for inflation
and minimized checking for not attraactive

modearration of maximizing and minimizing is attractive
it is not loosing rewards awarded and have proper checking
