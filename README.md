==========

this is a way of doing a crypto dollars where the reward goes for maintaining the ledger, with no difficulty

please ask if you want to contribute, nothing personal, within the guide lines,
a subject in a forum, files, constructive opinions, normal official things are usually reasonable to consider.
the simplest versions are prefered. because it will be checked for integrity, often,

ledger is maintained and checked constantly,
transactions are checked constantly,
rewards goes to the number of transaction checked
wallets are crypted, what is in it is known
   
send 3 x 100
check it
approve, or not
send back 3 x 1000
accompany with ledger part
need 75% to 100% of the ledger checkers

 same anonymity in transactionthe
 3 x 100 , is sending to 100 users for checking in 3 checking track

 one checking track is sender x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100 x 100 checkers

 one sending back track is sender back x 1000 x 1000 x 1000 to be sure one

 3 track for safety gives 3 answers

 sender send 100 requests and receives 1000 replies pack of 1,000,000
 that gives the 75% to 100% of approval or not
 you are sure that it is not the same, senders and backsender, that are input and output
 the crypto is the same as other dollars

 send a request to change the contents of wallets,
 checkers are 100%,
 they check if the wallet contains the amount, and if there is doubling
 send a reply, isolate and check discrepencies

 ,

 checkers

 check integrity of the past ledger,

 wallet change request , approval or not,

 version, which should not change unless, at least,75% agrees ,

 reply,  all users implied in one request receive the reply, they can't lie on it, they both get it. and all back senders, wich are not always the same.

 big checkers, those who can check a lot, get requests according to that, but not to much, to stay decentralized.

 cost for checking, are covered in new crypto dollars , with the rewards for ledger checkers, and other sources if needed, but preferably not,

 test and suggestions are welcomed, nothing personal, and only suitable for all ages and vast majority of users,

 honest, easy to use, decentralized, optimized for at least 100,000,000 users at 10 requests sent a day,
 for cpu, to moderate asic  checking , to keep it decentralized,

 low usage for keeping rewards to checkers,

 sending a request to getting a reply, should be under 5 seconds,

 use of two checking schemes, is suggested, to avoid , or identify dicrepencies
